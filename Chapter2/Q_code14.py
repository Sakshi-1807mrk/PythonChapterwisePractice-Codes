# string concepts
# 1. print the value in string variable
name="Sakshi"
print("My name is",name) # it prints the string followed by the value in the string variable 

# 2. print the string which includes double quotations
print('He said,"she is my sister"') # whole string is enclosed in single quotations to avoid syntax errors
# to print the above using double quotations and avoid syntax error we use backslash
print("He said,\"she is my sister\"")
