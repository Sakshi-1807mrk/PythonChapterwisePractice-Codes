# Write a python program to add two numbers
# here int() is used before input() to convert user's input (string) into an integer
# if didn't use int function then python will concatenate assuming a and b as string 
a =int(input("Enter the num1 : "))
b =int(input("Enter the num2 : "))
print("The addition is :",(a+b))
